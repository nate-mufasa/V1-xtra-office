BMI Calculator
Description

This is a Python script that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their weight and height. The user can choose to input their weight in kilograms or pounds and their height in meters, centimeters, feet, or inches. The script will then convert the units if necessary and calculate the BMI according to the formula weight / (height * height). The user will then be given their BMI and a classification of whether they are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. The script also provides more information on BMI and tips on how to maintain a healthy BMI.
